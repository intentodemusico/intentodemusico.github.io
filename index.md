[Stegian V2: Steganography detection on color images using Deep Learning](/projects/stegian/):
<img src="projects/stegian/imgs/1.png?raw=true"/>
Developed a Deep Learning-based algorithm for detecting LSB steganography in color digital images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models with precision of 50% and an F1 score of 66%, comparable to Mamadaâ€™s model. The project delved into additional approaches contemplated in the state of the art for steganography detection, concluding that the complexity level of the models is not always proportional to obtaining successful results. F1 score, precision, training time, and estimation time were the performance metrics chosen for the evaluation of the deep learning model.

Note: LSB steganography is a branch of cybersecurity that embeds hidden messages in plain images, posing a significant threat to cybersecurity as it is difficult to detect by eye inspection.

[Credit risk model bundle (Forecasting, prediction and anomaly detection)](/projects/creditRisk/)
<img src="images/projects/creditRisk/forecasting.jpg?raw=true"/>
This project aimed to develop a credit risk model bundle using open-source machine learning libraries and in-house development to improve credit risk management for SMBs lending. By utilizing transactional data from multiple partners, the framework could accurately identify possible non-performing loans in advance, resulting in a 14% reduction in NPL. The implementation of MLOps strategies ensured consistent model performance and improved the efficiency, scalability, and sustainability of the framework. The project highlights the importance of data-driven approaches and advanced machine learning techniques in credit risk management.

[Metaculus hackathon](/projects/metaculus/)
<img src="images/projects/metaculus.png?raw=true"/>
The project created an NLP-driven Topic Engine that identifies important topics in the Metaculus dataset and creates a knowledge graph with their key relationships. The graph was modeled using Neo4j, a graph database, and the Wikifier API was used to extract topics from questions in the dataset. The resulting knowledge graph was analyzed using Cypher queries to gain insights into the dynamics and structure of the data, which could be used to improve forecasting models and make more accurate predictions. The project demonstrates the usefulness of NLP-driven Topic Engines and graph databases in data analysis and decision-making.
