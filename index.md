## Data/ML 

### [Stegian V2: Steganography detection on color images using Deep Learning](/projects/stegian/):
<img src="projects/stegian/imgs/1.png?raw=true"/>
Multiple models to detect embeddings on color images using **Deep Learning/Machine Learning** approaches. Surpassed state-of-the-art metrics at the time.


Note: LSB steganography is a branch of cybersecurity that embeds hidden messages in plain images, posing a significant threat to cybersecurity as it is difficult to detect by eye inspection.

### [Credit risk model bundle (Forecasting, prediction and anomaly detection)](/projects/creditRisk/)
<img src="images/projects/creditRisk/forecasting.jpg?raw=true"/>
Reduced non-performing-loans by **14%** by developing a credit risk framework using MLOps and open-source, ensuring the framework's efficiency, scalability, and sustainability.

---
### [Metaculus hackathon](/projects/metaculus/)
<img src="images/projects/metaculus.png?raw=true"/>
**NLP-driven** Topic Engine to identify important topics and create a **knowledge graph**. The resulting knowledge graph was analyzed using Cypher queries to gain insights into the dynamics and structure of the data, which could be used to improve forecasting models and make more accurate predictions.
