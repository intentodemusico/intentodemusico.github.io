## KardexAPP: Web extension for extracting students' completed modules

**Project context:** The UPB University needed to obtain certain data from students' academic history as a recurrent task, this, taking around 15 minutes per student, made the faculty spend long hours on the process, having to schedule appoinments for this matter.
Since the data should be obtained from the faculty's head computer, the application had to work as a Chrome extension, without any installation.

**Outcomes:** The time taken for this process was reduced from 15 minutes to around 10 seconds per student. Optimizing this process allowed faculty members to improve their performance since this extension was developed.
