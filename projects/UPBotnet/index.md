## UPBotnet: IoT Botnet

**Resume:** Highly available botnet using arduino devices and python, allowed to test multiple attacks to controlled network environments. Developed from scratch using MQTT protocols and networking knowledge.


## How it works?
<!--
##### There's three kind of node: common, master and slave
##### Every node starts as a common node. If there's no master one, common node will be the master. 
##### If a node starts and master is alive, but there's no slave; common node will be the slave.
##### If a node starts after master and slave are setted up, common will still common until the nodes queue makes it slave or master.


##### If master dies, slave will replace it, and next common node in queue will be set up as slave.
##### If slave dies, nobody will take it's place.
##### If common dies, nobody will take it's place.
