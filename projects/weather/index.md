## Weather forecasting

**Project context:** The Bucaramanga metropolitan area is a certain region within Colombia where multiple thermal floors are present. Given the nature of the tropical environment, and the geographical characteristics of Bucaramanga, it is posible to have different temperature levels and weathers at the same time. The mountain winds can affect the expected weather for the day, that is why a sensor net distributed along all the city is required.
Analyzing the data this sensors provide is a task addressed by numerical method techniques and forecasting, since it is no possible to have a certain node data all the time.
The distance and location of each node station is unknown, making it a perfect opportunity for using these approaches.
