## Credit risk model bundle (Forecasting, prediction and anomaly detection)

**Project context:** Certain company is focused on SMBs lending, obtaining merchant's transactional data from different partners, such as POS system companies, delivery apps and payment gateways affiliated with the respective SMB merchant. The credit model measures how well a merchant is performing in a Certain window frame, thus, giving credits to the bestest ones. Certain merchants received the lending and then stopped performing as well as before (or even stopped using the partners infrastructure), falling into a NPL (non performing loan) status. Since the company's ability to collect the credit depends on the partner's transactional data, the probability of getting paid by these merchants tends to be low because there is not enough certainty on the future behavior of the loaned merchants. 

**Project goal:** The goal of this project was to develop a forecasting framework that will aid in reducing non-performing loans and enhance credit risk management for SMBs lending. The framework would rely on merchant's transactional data obtained from multiple partners to evaluate SMBs' performance over a specific time period. By detecting possible non-performing loans in advance, the framework allowed the company to take proactive steps to minimize the risk of default and minimize its financial impact. The ultimate objective was to improve the creditworthiness of the lending portfolio, resulting in a more stable and profitable lending business.

**Solution design:** 

**Outcomes:** Using multiple sources, a Forecasting/Anomaly Detection/Risk Reduction Framework was implemented. 

**Takeaways:** The NPL was reduced in 14%, meaning a more stable and trustworthy pool of loan candidates was selected.
