## Credit risk model bundle (Forecasting, prediction and anomaly detection)

**Project context:** Certain company is focused on SMBs lending, obtaining merchant's transactional data from different partners, such as POS system companies, delivery apps and payment gateways affiliated with the respective SMB merchant. The credit model measures how well a merchant is performing in a Certain window frame, thus, giving credits to the bestest ones. Certain merchants received the lending and then stopped performing as well as before (or even stopped using the partners infrastructure), falling into a NPL (non performing loan) status. Since the company's ability to collect the credit depends on the partner's transactional data, the probability of getting paid by these merchants tends to be low because there is not enough certainty on the future behavior of the loaned merchants.
