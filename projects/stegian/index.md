## Stegian V2

**Project context:** The steganography is a branch of cybersecurity, focused on embedding hidden messages into plain images. The embedded message could vary from simple text to remote code execution scripts, making it a big threat to cybersecurity. It is impossible to determine by eye inspection whether or not an image is altered, this leading to the possibility of compromising the companies' technological infrastructure. The proposed solution helps to prevent the possible attacks by determining if an image contains or not a steganographic payload. 

**Project goals:** The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm using convolutional neural networks to detect LSB steganography in color digital images. Steganography is a branch of cybersecurity that embeds hidden messages in plain images, posing a significant threat to cybersecurity as it is difficult to detect by eye inspection. The proposed solution aims to prevent possible attacks by automating the detection process of LSB steganography.

**Solution design:** The proposed solution involves the development of a Deep Learning-based algorithm for detecting LSB steganography in color digital images. The solution begins with the collection of color digital images from various sources and preprocessing them through techniques such as image normalization, resizing, and augmentation to generate a dataset for the training and testing of the algorithm. The algorithm is then designed to implement convolutional neural networks, taking into account the characteristics of the input and output data identified in the literature review. Implementation is carried out using a suitable Deep Learning framework and programming language. Validation of the algorithm's performance in detecting LSB steganography is conducted using appropriate metrics and validation methods inherent to Deep Learning, with testing done on the generated dataset. The iterative improvement process is employed to analyze the results of testing and validation and identify areas for improvement in the algorithm's design and implementation, iterating through steps 3-5 until the desired level of performance is achieved.

**Results:** ANN and CNN models for detecting embedding artifacts on color images.

**Takeaways:** Not necesarily a larger model will make a better prediction.
